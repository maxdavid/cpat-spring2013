ML: Homework 5
==============

* Fill in the rest of the table for computing the variance for a binomial distribution with p = 0.8 and n = 2.

```
Xᵢ  | P(x) | XᵢP(Xᵢ) | Xᵢ – μ | (Xᵢ – μ)²
0   | 0.04 |
1   | 0.32 |
2   |      |
    ————–———
      μ =
```

* Find a 90% confidence interval for a normal random variable with sample average = 20 and sample standard deviation = 10, and N = 25. Show your work.

* Referring to Figure 6.8b on P. 221, there are six leaf nodes. For the third leaf node, numbering from the left, write a rule that would capture exactly the instances in that leaf node.

* Explain what a normalized list of attributes is and why normalization is important.

* Give a distance metric between two instances each with 5 binary attributes: a1, ... a5.
