ML: Homework 3
==============
Due Friday May 10

1. Compute the information gain and gain ratio for a decision tree with leaf nodes: 
```
{0,0,0,1,1,2}, {1,1,1,2}, {2,2,2}
```

2. Simplify the expression
```
log2(3/5) + log2(5/7) + log2(7/9)
```

3. What is log<sub>e</sub>(1)?

4. Apply a version of the k-means algorithm (Euclidean distance) to create two clusters for the following data:
```
(1, 0), (2, 0), (2.9, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0)
```
 * When does the algorithm terminate?
 * Does the result depend on which points you choose as the seeds?
 * What is the recommended strategy in the text?
 * What are the possible clusters?

5. find the inverse of the following matrix:
```
| 1  1|
|-1  1|
```
