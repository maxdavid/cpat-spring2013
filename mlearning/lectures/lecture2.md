Lecture 2
=========

## Topics for the quarter

* What are Concepts, Instances, Attributes
* Knowledge representation
* Rule Lists, Trees, Linear Models
* Training a machine learning system
* Cleaning and Transforming Data
* Bayesian Networks
* Clustering
* Neural Networks
* Regression

## Readings for this week

* Chapter 1 in Witten

## Additional resources

* *Artificial Intelligence*, Russell and Norvig
* *Reinforcement Learning*, Sutton and Barto
* *Principles of Computer Security **Lab Manual***, Nestler, White, Conklin â€” not the one by Conklin and White
* Seattle networking environment: [seattle.cs.washington.edu](https://seattle.cs.washington.edu/html/)

## Algorithms

* rules, P. 6, there are 24 rows, how many possible functions are there from a set of 24 instances to a set of 3 outcomes?
* In general, the data is noisy
* decision list vs decision tree. P. 13
* generalization

## Data

* What kinds of data are there?
* Why data needs to be cleaned/preprocessed: missing values, inconsistent values
* Summarizing data: mean, standard deviation, min, max, quartiles
* attribute subset selection: finding a minimum set of attributes that adequately describes the concept.
