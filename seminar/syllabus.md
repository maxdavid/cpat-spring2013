# Seminar Syllabus, Spring 2013

The seminar theme, echoes the program theme of how computing might advance the natural and physical sciences, particularly environmental science and climate change studies.  The seminar will focus on how computation and statistics can have an impact on science and society through data mining, visualization, and machine learning.  We will also consider how computing impacts statistics (and vice versa) and how science also impacts computation and statistics.

Seminar class meetings consist of both a guest lecture series (on Tuesday afternoons, 3:30-4:45, in LH 5) and seminar sessions (Mondays 1-3) in SEM II E 2107, 2109, and 3107.  In seminar, students will share responsibility for presenting and discussing concepts from both readings and lectures.

For the weekly papers, students can write on the question posted by faculty (on the program web site by the preceding Thursday 5pm), or on a question of their own making.

 Students will be evaluated based on their understanding of the program themes as evidenced by their weekly papers and participation in seminar discussions, on the quality of their feedback to peers’ papers, on the technical quality of their papers, their performance on the 2-3 weekly questions on the seminar readings (given with the stats quiz Tuesday morning), and their attendance.
