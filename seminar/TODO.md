## Week 7
#### First half of Jaron Lanier’s You are Not a Gadget (pp. 1-99)
[Submission Forum][moo7]

##### Prompts
* Lainer is very aware of how technology can structure consciousness. Pick a pre-internet technology (the printing press, the automobile, municipal water, vaccines, electricity, etc) and compare its effects on consciousness with the effects of the internet as Lanier sees them.
* Jaron Lanier sees the “singularity” as a technological heaven, and thus a turning away from reason. Is this your understanding of the singularity?
* Lanier creates an amazing dystopia of the present. The main element lacking from his narrative is a protagonist.  Write a two page short story about a character (or non-character) who lives in Lanier’s dystopia.

## Week 6
#### Two papers from Bill Howe, our Tuesday speaker 
*(we strongly suggest you read the first paper BEFORE the second)*
[Submission Forum][moo6]

1. [SQLShare: ScientificWorkflow via Relational View Sharing.][sqlshare1]  Bill Howe, Francois Ribalet, Daniel Halperin, Sagar Chitnis, E. Virginia Armbrust, Computers in Science and Engineering (CiSE), May/June 2013 (to appear).
2. [Real-Time Collaborative Analysis with (Almost) Pure SQL: A Case Study in Biogeochemical Oceanography.][sqlshare2]  Daniel Halperin, Konstantin Weitz, Bill Howe, Francois Ribalet, E. Virginia Armbrust.  Scientific and Statistical Database Conference Proceedings, Portland, OR.  2011.

##### Prompts
**NOTE:** DO NOT summarize part of the reading. Instead, provide an interpretation of and/or an opinion about what you read. If you feel like the default topics are leading you down a path to summary, please choose your own topic to discuss.

* In the business world the “as-a-service” model (Software as-a-service, Platform as-a-service, etc.) gives companies the ability to turn computing technology into a predictable expense. What does the “as-a-service” model give the scientific community?
* Both Howe and Megler’s systems improve the availability of scientific data. Their data even comes from similar sources like scientific cruises. However, these projects result in very different systems. Compare and contrast the requirements and results of the “Data near Here” project and the SQLShare project. (If you chose this topic take care to have a thesis and not just a list of observations).


## Week 5
#### Lady-Tasting Tea (2nd half)
[Submission Forum][moo5]

##### Prompts
**NOTE:** DO NOT summarize part of the reading or retell a story told by Salsberg in the text. Instead, provide an interpretation of and/or an opinion about what you read. If you feel like the default topics are leading you down a path to summary, please choose your own topic to discuss.

* L.J. Cohen believes that decisions based on probabilistic arguments are not logical decisions (p. 300).  Consider this argument and discuss whether or not statistical models can be used to make decisions.
* Does statistics primarily deal with distinctions “below the level of human perception” as Suppes argues (p. 307) ? If so, how can it be relevant? How does this insight apply to computing?

## Week 4
#### [Data Near Here][dnh]
[Submission Forum][moo4]

* If you are interested in more technical depth about this project, see:  Megler, V.M. and Maier, D.: [When Big Data Leads to Lost Data.][dnh2] Winner of PIKM “Best Paper” award. In: PIKM 2012: 5th Workshop for Ph.D. Students at CIKM, Maui, Hawaii (2012).
* Alternatively, if you are more interested in how to present research to a general audience, take a look at the ideas in [Science as Storytelling][scisto].

##### Prompts
* Write a short analysis of the assigned paper.  See [Analysis of a Scientific Paper][anacon] for direction!
* Write about how well you think the paper accomplishes the goal of communicating with domain scientists (rather than only to computer scientists). See [Presenting CS Research to a (more) general audience][anaexp] for direction!

## Week 3
#### The Lady-Tasting Tea (first half)
[Submission Forum][moo3]

##### Prompts
* David Salsburg in The Lady Tasting Tea paints a very personal picture of the development of a new scientific discipline (statistics!).  In particular, you are presented with a kind of feud between Fisher and Pearson, a feud that was only partially based on personality.  As best you can, describe the fundamental differences in the approaches to statistics taken by these two key figures in the history of statistics.
* The Lady Tasting Tea describes in some detail how certain statistical innovations arose from real world problems (e.g., crop rotation, beer mash fermentation for Guiness, etc.).  Pick one of the several  problems in the book, describe it, and then tell the statistical story related to that problem.    What was it about the problem that required or inspired innovation?   If you can address or speculate, how did the particular innovation lead to a more general idea that was more widely applicable?

## Week 2
#### Thinking in Systems
[Submission Forum][moo2]

##### Prompt
*  The author (of Thinking in Systems) contrasts systems thinking with science, logic and reductionism (in Ch. 1, p 4 and elsewhere) .  She goes on to claim that the methodologies presented in the book (essentially building and observing the dynamics of stock/flow models), while “not necessarily better” than reductionism allows us to “reclaim our intuition” in ways that could lead to better understanding of the natural world, and policy decisions  (p. 6, for example).  What evidence does she give for this cliam?  How can a model, which is itself a formal system, lend itself to holistic thinking?
