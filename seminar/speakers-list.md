#### PLATO
The Evergreen PLATO Lecture Series was endowed in ~1985 by John Aikin to fund an annual series of lectures about computing and its implications and applications.  Funds for the lecture series were set up in perpetuity from royalties accrued from [PLATO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLATO_%28computer_system%29) (Programmed Logic for Automated Teaching Operations) CAI (Computer Aided Instruction) courses for BASIC and Pascal written by Aikin and his Evergreen students under a grant from CDC (Control Data Corporation).  Originally written in American English, those courses were translated into many other (natural) languages and given worldwide exposure.  There is now a PLATO simulation [Cyber1](http://www.cyber1.org/), though the Evergreen courses have not been loaded.  Rumor has it that there were many fine games on this system, which was 30+ years ahead of its time.
